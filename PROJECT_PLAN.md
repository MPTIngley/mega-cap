#### Integration Status

| Scanner            | Status        | Notes                      |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| **AI Pulse**       | ✅ Integrated | Sentiment section in email |
| **Trillion+ Club** | ⏳ Deferred   | Future integration         |
| **Long-Term**      | ⏳ Deferred   | Future integration         |

#### Daily Workflow

1. 17:00 ET: Scheduler runs sentiment-scan (caches for AI Pulse)
2. Results cached in `sentiment_daily` table
3. 17:30 ET: AI Pulse email includes "Social Sentiment" section
4. Haiku analyzes top bullish/bearish tickers

#### Cost Estimates (Current)

| Component                      | Monthly Cost       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| StockTwits API                 | **$0** (free)      |
| Claude Haiku (~6 analyses/day) | ~$2                |
| Finnhub (optional)             | **$0** (free tier) |
| **Total**                      | **~$2/month**      |

### API Capacity Analysis

**Current usage vs limits:**
| API | Rate Limit | Current Use | Daily Capacity | Utilization |
|-----|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| StockTwits | ~200/hour | 80/day | 4,800/day | **1.7%** |
| Finnhub | 60/min | 80/day | 86,400/day | **0.1%** |

**Conclusion:** We're using <2% of available API capacity. Room for hourly collection.

### API Keys Required

```bash
# Add to .env (OPTIONAL - StockTwits works without any keys)
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Optional: https://finnhub.io/register (free)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=already_set  # Required for Haiku analysis
```

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                   | Mitigation                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| StockTwits rate limits | 500ms delay, retry logic, cache daily      |
| API failures           | Exponential backoff retries (3 attempts)   |
| Sentiment noise        | Use as confirming factor only, not primary |
| Module not working     | **Isolated code** - can be removed cleanly |
| Cost overruns          | Start free, only add paid if value proven  |

### Success Metrics

- Sentiment data for 80%+ of AI universe daily
- <$10/month total API costs
- API failure rate <5% (with retries)
- User finds sentiment section valuable in AI Pulse email
- No impact on existing scanner reliability

## Notes for Claude Code

- Martin is a data scientist. He thinks in terms of experimentation and statistical rigor. Every strategy needs backtested evidence before going live.
- Charts must be publication-quality: white background, large fonts, clear labels. No default styling. Ever.
- Martin prefers to talk through design before coding. Ask before building if requirements are ambiguous.
- Use type hints. Write docstrings. Keep functions small and testable.
- Config-driven everything. No magic numbers in strategy code.
- **ALWAYS give pull/run/test commands** at end of changes. No comments in command blocks (Mac terminal hates them).

### Cost-Conscious Data Strategy (IMPORTANT)

**GOAL:** Maximize free data sources, minimize paid API calls (especially Claude/Anthropic).

| Data Type            | Source          | Cost     | Usage     |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Social Sentiment     | StockTwits      | FREE     | Unlimited |
| News Sentiment       | Finnhub         | FREE     | 60/min    |
| News Headlines       | Google News RSS | FREE     | Unlimited |
| Analyst Ratings      | Finnhub         | FREE     | 60/min    |
| Insider Transactions | Finnhub         | FREE     | 60/min    |
| Search Interest      | Google Trends   | FREE     | ~10/min   |
| Market Mood          | CNN Fear&Greed  | FREE     | Unlimited |
| Options Sentiment    | yfinance        | FREE     | Unlimited |
| Attention Spikes     | Wikipedia       | FREE     | 100/sec   |
| AI Analysis          | Claude Haiku    | **PAID** | **LIMIT** |

**Haiku Usage Rules:**

- Only analyze top 3 bullish + top 3 bearish stocks per day (6 total)
- Never run Haiku on hourly scans - only daily aggregation
- Cache Haiku results for 24 hours - don't re-analyze same ticker
- Target: <$5/month Anthropic spend

## Git Hygiene (Claude Code must follow)

### Branch Strategy

- **Feature branch**: `claude/init-repo-setup-maaOL` — All Claude Code work happens here
- **Main branch**: `main` — Production code, updated via merge from feature branch
- Martin pulls from feature branch on his local machine, merges to main, pushes to origin

### Workflow for Claude Code

1. **Always work on feature branch**: `git checkout claude/init-repo-setup-maaOL`
2. **Commit frequently** with clear messages describing what changed
3. **Push to feature branch**: `git push -u origin claude/init-repo-setup-maaOL`
4. **Never force push** or rewrite history
5. **Update PROJECT_PLAN.md** at end of each session with work done

### Permissions

- **Martin has full push access to `main`** — can push directly after merging feature branch
- Claude Code cannot push to `main` (403 protected) — works on feature branch only

### Workflow for Martin (local machine)

```bash
# Pull latest from feature branch
git fetch origin claude/init-repo-setup-maaOL
git checkout main
git merge origin/claude/init-repo-setup-maaOL

# Push to main (Martin has permission)
git push origin main

# Run the app
stockpulse run
```

### Commit Message Format

```
Short summary of change (50 chars max)

- Bullet point details if needed
- What was added/changed/fixed

https://claude.ai/code/session_ID
```

### Session Checklist (Claude Code)

- [ ] Read PROJECT_PLAN.md at session start
- [ ] Work on feature branch only
- [ ] Commit and push changes
- [ ] Update PROJECT_PLAN.md with session work
- [ ] Give Martin pull/merge commands at session end
